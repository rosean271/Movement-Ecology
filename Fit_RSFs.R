#################### Population-level RSF #########################
# We want to determine use within the NCA assuming 9 prairie falcons #
# are a representative sample of the population. #

# When would this not be the case? #
# Answer:
#

# We start with our finest resolution of predictors:
msa_100m <- glmmTMB( case_ ~ 1 + annual_100m + perennial_100m +
                       shrub_100m,
                     family = binomial(), data = sa_scl, 
                     weights = weight ) 
#view results
summary( msa_100m )
# How do you interpret the summary table of results?
# Answer:
#
# Now we look at 500m resolution
msa_500m <- glmmTMB( case_ ~ 1 + annual_500m + perennial_500m +
                       shrub_500m,
                     family = binomial(), data = sa_scl, 
                     weights = weight ) 

summary( msa_500m )
#Did inference change at the bigger scale?
# Answer:
#

#which scale has the most support? We compare model fit using AIC
anova( msa_100m, msa_500m)

# Which scale is most supported by model selection?
# Answer:
#

# Interpreting results of the top model ###
# we start by exponentiating the coefficients:
exp( glmmTMB::fixef( msa_100m )$cond )
# this reflects the relative selection strength for choosing each
# vegetation cover when the remaining vegetation covers are kept 
# at their mean values
# Thus prairie falcons are 1.45 times more likely to choose
# shrub with cover that is 1 SD higher when annual and perennial are 
# kept at their mean

# To remind ourselves what the SD for our predictor is
apply( df_sa[,prednames], 2, sd )
# And now the mean values for each habitat:
apply( df_sa[,prednames], 2, mean )

# So a Prarie Falcon will be 1.4 times more likely to use an area with 10 %
# shrub than 2.8 % shrub when annual is 19% and perennial is 13.5 %

#What would be the equivalent statement for annual?
# Answer: 
#

# plot differences in distribution between used and available #
# locations for our predictor of choice. To plot on the real scale we #
# combine unscaled data first:
ggplot( df_sa ) +
  theme_bw( base_size = 15 ) +
  geom_density( aes( x = shrub_100m, 
                     fill = case_, group = case_ ),
                alpha = 0.5  ) 
#now for perennial
ggplot( df_sa ) +
  theme_bw( base_size = 15 ) +
  geom_density( aes( x = perennial_100m, 
                     fill = case_, group = case_ ),
                alpha = 0.5  )  
#for annual:
ggplot( df_sa ) +
  theme_bw( base_size = 15 ) +
  geom_density( aes( x = annual_100m, 
                     fill = case_, group = case_ ),
                alpha = 0.5  )  

#What do these plots tell us about how prairie falcons select habitat?
# Is it reasonable to assume that all individuals are selecting 
# habitat similarly?
# Answer:
