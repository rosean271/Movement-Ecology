# Vegetation cover  was downloaded from Rangeland Analysis Platform #
# https://rangelands.app/products/ for 2021 and includes        #

# tree, litter and bare ground                                   #
# coordinate system is WGS84 EPSG:4326, spatial resolution is 30m #

# Prairie Falcon data was thinned to 20 seconds for 9 individuals #
# tracked in 2021 and uses NAD83 UTM zone 11N +                   #
# which is the same as the NCA polygon                           #
# Jen plotted 5 sec, 10 sec, 15 sec, etc. to see which time interval was
# good and found 20 seconds was good for smoothed data

#annual = mostly cheatgrass, PRFA seem to mostly ignore it and don't select for or against

#### what do you interpret from this plot?
# is amount of vegetation influencing results?
# Answer:
# no, otherwise you'd see individuals selecting less or more as the predictor increases
#or there's a "sweet spot" where individuals seem to like
#availability doesn't seem like a driver 
#other explanations: maybe different prey preferences or whether they are sitting on the nest or
#hunting (sex-based differences), different hunting styles even for same prey
#if they have different hunting styles, maybe we'd see different movement patterns/behaviors,
#or they are moving throug certain habitat, but ssfs don't capture that
# What about sex?

#model may have failed bc some individuals have crazy confidence intervals and values
#produced are unrealistic
#should start to worry if ci is more than 10
#you may have overparameterized and model is too complicated
#either have to simplify for everyone or take out the two individuals 
#(BUT our sample size is too small already)
#OR put all individuals in same model with random slopes (will do that next week)
#Note: can't fit a model with just interaction effects (when there's two coeff together) 
#without main effects ever

#for shrub, you can see that areas with more shrub, esp at 16%, have PRFA selecting against
#16% vs 8% shrub is actually a pretty significant difference in the landscape
